# Yu Orie – ナイト・アンド・ダーク

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Night and dark
Forever in my heart
Walking in the midnight rain
I'll never fall in love again
Night and dark
Nobody to see me cry
And like a flower slowly dies
So will I
Night and dark
In your shadows I can hide my
pain
In my heart
The light will never shine again
The light will never shine again
Night and dark
Forever in my heart
For all the love I ever lost
My soul now feels a bitter frost
Night and dark
Forever when you say goodbye
All the stars will fade and die
In my sky
Night and dark
In your shadows I can hide my
pain
In my heart
The light will never shine again
The light will never shine again
Night and dark
Forever in my heart
I'll always sing a song that's
sad
For all the love I never had
Night and dark
Until the earth begins to crack
I know I'll never get them back
Roll the credits fade to black
God's tears are falling
Like stars they are falling
For the host of angels
Dying in my soul
God's tears are falling
Heaven's calling
Calling me, calling
A drifter alone in the dark
In the dark you'll never see me
cry
In the dark you'll never see me
cry
You'll never see the tears in my
eyes
You'll never see the tears that
I try to hide
In the night and dark
